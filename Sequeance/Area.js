//Question 5: Calculating Measure Units

//Step 1: Calculating for Nth feet
let Firstft = 12;
console.log("The inche for 1ft = " + Firstft);
let nft = 42/12;
console.log("The feet for 42 inches = " + nft);

//Step 2: Calculating area for 1 plot
let area = 60 * 40;
console.log("The area of one plot = " + area);

//Step 3: Calculating area for n plots
let totalarea = area * 25;
console.log("The areas of 25 plots = " + totalarea);
